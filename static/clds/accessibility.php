<p>This website is run by the Library
and University Collections Directorate which is part of Information

<li>Magnify text to 200%</li>
<li>Experience no cognitive test</li>
<li>Experience no time limits when using the website</li>
</ul>
<p>

</p>
<p>We’ve

where there is no easier wording we could use without changing what
the text means.</p>

<p>We
aim to improve our websites accessibility on a regular and continuous
basis. See the section below ('What we're doing to improve
accessibility') on how we are improving our site accessibility. 
</p>
<p>

<!-- {{The site may not be in full control. If it isn't, the below is likely incorrect}} -->
</p>
<p>We
are working towards solving these problems and expect significant
improvements by November 2025. The site is fully within our control.</p>
<p>

<!-- {{The statement may make claims of disproportionate burden, double-check that it matches below}} -->
</p>
<h3>Disproportionate burden</h3>
<p>
We
are not currently claiming that any accessibility problems would be a
disproportionate burden to fix.</p>
<p>

<!-- {{The statement may make claims of not within scope of regulations, double-check that it matches below}} -->
</p>
<h3>Content that’s not within the scope of the accessibility regulations</h3>
<p>

</p>
<p>At
this time we believe no content is outwith the scope of the accessibility regulations.</p>
<p>

</p>
<h2>What we’re doing to improve accessibility</h2>
<p>

</p>

<!-- {{The site may not be in full control. If it isn't, the below is likely incorrect}} -->
<p>We
will continue to address and make significant improvements to the
accessibility issues highlighted. Unless specified otherwise, a
complete solution or significant improvement will be in place by November 2025. The site is completely within our control.
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>While
we are in the process of resolving these accessibility issues we will
ensure reasonable adjustments are in place to make sure no user is
disadvantaged. As changes are made, we will continue to review
accessibility and retest the accessibility of this website.</p>
<p>

</p>
<h2>Preparation of this accessibility statement</h2>
<p><b>This statement was prepared on 20th September 2021. It was last reviewed on 2nd December 2024. The website was last tested on November 20th 2024.</b></p>
<p>

</p>
<p>The
testing was carried out by the Library
and University Collections Directorate which is part of Information
Services Group at the University of Edinburgh using
both automated and manual methods. The site was tested on a PC,
primarily using Microsoft Edge alongside Mozilla Firefox and Google
Chrome.</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>Recent
world-wide usage levels survey for different screen readers and
browsers shows that Chrome, Mozilla Firefox and Microsoft Edge are
increasing in popularity and Google Chrome is now the favoured
browser for screen readers:</p>
<p>

</p>
<p><a href="https://webaim.org/projects/screenreadersurvey9/">WebAIM:
Screen Reader User Survey</a></p>
<p>

</p>
<p>The
aforementioned three browsers have been used in certain questions for
reasons of breadth and variety.</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>We
ran automated testing using <a href="https://wave.webaim.org/">WAVE
WebAIM</a> and AXE and
then manual testing that included:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Spell
	check functionality;</li>
	<li>Scaling
	using different resolutions and reflow;</li>
	<li>Options
	to customise the interface (magnification, font, background colour,
	etc);</li>
	<li>Keyboard
	navigation and keyboard traps;</li>
	<li>Data
	validation;</li>
	<li>Warning
	of links opening in new tab or window;</li>
	<li>Information
	conveyed in the colour or sound only;</li>
	<li>Flashing,
	moving or scrolling text;</li>
	<li>Use
	with screen reading software (for example JAWS);</li>
	<li>Assistive
	software (TextHelp Read and Write, Windows Magnifier, ZoomText,
	Dragon Naturally Speaking, TalkBack and VoiceOver);</li>
	<li>Tooltips
	and text alternatives for any non-text content;</li>
	<li>Time
	limits;</li>
	<li>Compatibility
	with mobile accessibility functionality (Android and iOS).</li>
	<li>Any
	drag functionality and alternatives</li>
	<li>Consistent
	help function</li>
	<li>No
	need to re enter data already submitted</li>
	<li>Any
	cognitive tests 
	</li>
</ul>
