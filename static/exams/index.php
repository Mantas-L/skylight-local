        <h4>Search Tips</h4>
        <ul>
            <!--<li>Please note that courses may not run every year and so it is possible that search results may not include papers for each year</li>
            <li>If searching by course code please be aware that a new code structure was introduced by the University in 2010/11 and so a search on code may produce incomplete results</li>-->
            <li>Typing in the course name or code will bring up suggestions for records already in the database.</li>
            <li>If you cannot find the paper you are looking for from a title search try entering the course code. Course codes changed format in 2010/11 so results will be different before and after this time.</li>
            <li>You can browse to the paper you are looking for by clicking the options on the right-hand side of the screen to narrow the results by School, subject, year and title.</li>
