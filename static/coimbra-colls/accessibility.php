<h2>Preparation of this accessibility statement</h2>
<p><b>This statement was prepared on 15th September 2021. It was last reviewed on 6th May 2025.</b></p>

<p><b>The website was last tested in January 2025. The
testing was carried out by Library
and University Collections, Information Services Group at the University of Edinburgh</b> using
both automated and manual methods. The site was tested on a PC,
primarily using Microsoft Edge alongside Mozilla Firefox and Google
Chrome.</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>Recent
world-wide usage levels survey for different screen readers and
browsers shows that Chrome, Mozilla Firefox and Microsoft Edge are
increasing in popularity and Google Chrome is now the favoured
browser for screen readers:</p>

<p><a href="https://webaim.org/projects/screenreadersurvey9/">WebAIM:
Screen Reader User Survey</a></p>
<p>

</p>
<p>The
aforementioned three browsers have been used in certain questions for
reasons of breadth and variety.</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>We
ran automated testing using <a href="https://www.deque.com/axe/devtools/chrome-browser-extension/">AXE Devtools</a> and
then manual testing that included:</p>

<h2>Change Log</h2
<p>
Since our initial report, we have undertaken more extensive manual testing with assistive software to get a better understanding of the accessibility issues on this website. This section will receive updates as and when accessibility improvements are made to the website.</p>
<p> In 2024, the following improvements were made: </p>
<p>
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Links are now underlined by default so no information is conveyed by colour only - <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#use-of-color">1.4.1 Use of Colour</a></li>
    <li>All colour contrasts were adjusted to meet the WCAG standards - <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#contrast-minimum">1.4.3 Contrast Minimum</a></li>
    <li>A skip to main content option was added to pages - <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#bypass-blocks">2.4.1 Bypass Blocks</a></li>
    <li>Where justified text was used, it was changed to left align</li>
</ul>
