<!-- {{The site may not be in full control. If it isn't, the below is likely incorrect}} -->

ensure reasonable adjustments are in place to make sure no user is

<h2>Preparation of this accessibility statement</h2>
<p><b>This statement was prepared on 15th September 2021. It was last reviewed on 22nd July 2025.</b></p> 

<p><b>The website was last tested on 19th July 2025. The

both automated and manual methods. The site was tested on a PC,
primarily using Microsoft Edge alongside Mozilla Firefox and Google
Chrome.</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>Recent
world-wide usage levels survey for different screen readers and
browsers shows that Chrome, Mozilla Firefox and Microsoft Edge are
increasing in popularity and Google Chrome is now the favoured
browser for screen readers:</p>

aforementioned three browsers have been used in certain questions for
reasons of breadth and variety.</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>We
ran automated testing using <a href="https://www.deque.com/axe/devtools/chrome-browser-extension/">AXE Devtools</a> and
then manual testing that included:</p>
