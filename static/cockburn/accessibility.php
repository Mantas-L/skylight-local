<!-- {{The site may not be in full control. If it isn't, the below is likely incorrect}} -->

<h2>Preparation of this accessibility statement</h2>
<p><b>This statement was prepared on 15th September 2024. It was last reviewed on 14th February 2025.</b></p> 

<p><b>The website was last tested on 17th December 2024. The
testing was carried out by Library
and University Collections, Information Services Group at the University of Edinburgh</b> using
both automated and manual methods. The site was tested on a PC,
primarily using Microsoft Edge alongside Mozilla Firefox and Google
Chrome.</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>Recent
world-wide usage levels survey for different screen readers and
browsers shows that Chrome, Mozilla Firefox and Microsoft Edge are
increasing in popularity and Google Chrome is now the favoured
browser for screen readers:</p>

<p>The
aforementioned three browsers have been used in certain questions for
reasons of breadth and variety.</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>We
ran automated testing using <a href="https://www.deque.com/axe/devtools/chrome-browser-extension/">AXE Devtools</a> and
then manual testing that included:</p>
