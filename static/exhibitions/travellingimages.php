            During the Renaissance, Venice was one most important European centres for book production and trade. Writers, scholars and artists worked there in collaboration with specialised artisans to produce perfected editions, which were often lavishly illustrated. In this small display we present three of our most interesting Venetian illustrated books and trace the paths they took in their travels from Venice, to our own institution.
