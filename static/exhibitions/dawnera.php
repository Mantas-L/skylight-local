            The NHS was born on 5 July 1948. From Scotland’s pre-1948 experiments in state health care, to medical breakthroughs, public health challenges and patient power, this display highlights the past 70 years of our region’s medical history through the collections of Lothian Health Services Archive (LHSA).
