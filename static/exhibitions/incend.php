        <p>In 1517 Martin Luther nailed his Ninety Five Theses to the door of Wittenberg Church and sparked the beginning
            of the Protestant Reformation. Featuring key publications by Luther, his supporters and those who opposed him,
            Incendiary Texts examines how these printed texts fuelled debate and controversy across 16th century Europe.</p>
